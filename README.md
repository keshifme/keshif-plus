## Installation

To install dependencies:
- npm install

To create the keshif+ packages:
- npm run rollup

or

- npm run rollup-watch 

This will create dist/assets/ directory, which is needed for full functionality.

To run sample dashboards on your computer:

- npm run start

Open sample dashboards by navigation to /samples/ directory, and specify the id parameter

- For example: http://localhost:5000/samples/?id=cars

### Installing icons

- Keshif uses font-awesome for icons, and you need a subscription to Font Awesome Pro to display all icons correctly.
- Use fontawesome.yaml with the Font Awesome Pro Subsetter application to generate the webfont & css files, and place them inside ./src/assets directory before creating keshif packages via rollup.
